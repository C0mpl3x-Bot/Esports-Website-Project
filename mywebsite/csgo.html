       <p>The NA Organisation 100Thieves Owned by Nadeshot, an ex professional call of duty player, has bought the renagades roster marking the return of 100Thieves back into the CSGO professional scene by buying this team out 100Thieves has got a guarantee to participate in the 2020 CSGO majors due to the team they have brought out reached the semi finals at the StarLAdder Major which was their highest finish in a huge tournament like this. </p>
        
       <p>To announce this buyout Nadeshot released a 8:57 minute youtube video where he explains his vision for the team and the reasoning for buying the team in the video he said "this is a long term-play" and "we want to support not only our players and this team,but we want ot help to support the CS:GO ecosystem so that this game continues to have more success as it already has in the last two decades" and he carries on saying "i think Counter Strike is the most passionate esports fanbase that i have been around.There is so much history, so many storylines, players and organisations who have been here before us that have laid out the ground work for an incrediable esports game". These quotes from the video sound like Nadeshot is very exictied to be back on the CSGO professional Scene and he wants to make the CSGO Professional Scene bigger and help it grow even more while using the CSGO professional scene to grow his brand and increase recognition 100thieves has world wide due to CSGO being a game that is played world wide. </p>
        
       <p>It is roumored that 100Thieves has potentially paied Renegades $2.2million which could be a huge risk 100Thieves is taking as they were unsuccessful when they first joined the CSGO professional scene in 2017 and the faliure in 2017 may raise questions on how they are sure they will be successful this time round with a lot of money being on the line meaning if they do not succeed they will be at a huge loss which can harm their brand image.</p>
