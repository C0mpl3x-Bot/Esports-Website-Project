       <p>The 2019 League of Legends World Championship was the ninth world championship for League of Legends, an esports tournament for the video game developed by Riot Games. It was held from October 2, 2019, to November 10, 2019, in Berlin, Madrid and Paris. The 2019 League of Legends World Championship has finally ended with many intense games occuring during the 2019 League of Legends World Championship where the NA teams were not able to get out of groups stage and the EU Teams not being able to bring the the worlds cup home even though the odds were in their favour and they were one of the best teams EU has ever had.</p>
        
       <p>The League of Legends World Championship started with play in groups this bracket was for people who came third in their region and they were put in to groups to face off, the winners of these would proceed into being able to participate in the Worlds Championship event and the teams that did pass through the plays in were DAMWON Gaming from Korea, Clutch Gaming from NA, Splyce from EU and finally Hong Kong Attitude from China. Then came along the next stage of the Worlds Championship which was the groups stage 16 teams from different regions were put into 4 groups of 4 and they had to face off the top 2 in the groups they are in would proceed into Quarterfinals. The teams that were able to move to the Quaterfinals were Invictus Gaming from China, GRIFFIN from Korea, FunPLus Phoenix from China,Fnatic from EU, Splyce from EU, SKT T1 from Korea,G2 from Eu and finally DAMWON Gaming from China.However unfortunatly Fnatic, Griffin, Splyce and DAMWON Gaming lost their best of five's by all going 3-1. Then the semifinals came along where the hopes of EU fans were high as the G2 team looked really strong they won their game aginst the old World Championship team SKT T1 and went to the finals and FunPlus Phoenix won their game and proceeded to the finals.However the EU Fans dreams were crushed when the Chinese team 3-0 G2 and caused them to loose the worlds championships meaning your new League of Legends World Championship team is FunPlus Phoneix.</p>
        
       <p>FunPlus Phoneix was the underdog of the best of 5 where everyone thought G2 esports was going to win the championship due to the team difference and mid difference but G2 was caught off guard and lost three games in a row causing them to loose the Championship and letting down millions of fans who supported them.</p>
