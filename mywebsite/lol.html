    <h2 class="centred">Latest News</h2>
    <img class="centred" id="header-img" alt="Image showing a pro player with a new contract" src="https://www.esportstalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/huni-contract.png">
    
        
       <p>Team Dignitas is making its way back in to the NA LCS after spending $20 million to merge with Clutch Gaming earlier this year and there are rumours that the Korean player Heo "Huni" seung-hoon is set to sign a multi million dollar contract that will last 2 years rumoured to be around $2.3 million guaranteed.This Salary would make Huni the highest paied players in the NA LCS.</p>
        
       <p>This guaranteed salary of 2.3 million dollars may put Team Dignitas in a bad spot as their overall slary for player budgets was a little over $3 million which means that Huni's slary has used up over 1/3 of their budget which can cuase it to be harder for them to sign other players as they need to sign 4 more players but as most of the budget is used up it can make it hader for them to have a good team that is ready to compete professionaly. Hence putting Team Dignitas a returning team that was in the League of legends professional scene in 2013-2017. By giving a singular player a 2 year guaranteed contract for $2.3 million can cause other problems for the team as the player would have a lot of power in the team and in decision making due to the player costing the team alot and if the player is not happy with decisions made within the team it can cause internal problems costing the team even more.</p>
    
       <p>There has been other rumours that dignitas has been rejected by players that they wanted as they were talking to multiple players that play in the same role as each other and once those players have found this out they have rejected to work with Team Dignitas as they did not see them selves as priority.But Team dignitas has finally managed to finalise their team roster with Huni in the Top Lane position, Grig in the Jungle position, Froggen in the Mid lane position, Johnsun as the ADC who will be in Bot lane with his support Aphromoo.</p>
