<h1>Report structure</h1>
<h2>Report: Large Coursework Omer Guven</h2>
<h2>Introduction: </h2>
<h3>• What is your site about? What is the essential story it tells? Background: 
•Who are your audience? Are there relevant stakeholders? 
•Give (at least) 3 examples that inspired you when creating your website. These could be
websites, guest speakers, artists, books, etc. </h3>
    
    <p>My website is about esports news so professional games news and news about the game and big changes that will happen on certain games. The story it tells is the latest news on a particular games.</p>

    <p>The audience and stakeholders for my website are gamers who follow esports on CSGO, League of Legends and Overwatch therefore my audience are gamers who play and CSGO, League of Legends and Overwatch and watch professional games on it. Stakeholders for my website are gamers and people who work on the website as they want to be able to create a fully functioning website where the information provided is accurate.</p>

    <p>What inspired me when creating my website was the gaming community because they are very invested into the games they play and the professional gaming scene and by creating this website I was able to meet the demand of gamers who want the latest news or want to know what’s happening or which team is doing the best in that particular game.</p>

    <p>A website that inspired me when creating my website was the Espn esports website (https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/28050294/2019-league-legends-free-agency-news-rumors-rosters
    ) this is because it is a very successful website to get news on particular games and by using this website as inspiration it gives me a good understanding of what the gaming community likes and it gave me a good idea of what type of information to add to my website and the type of structure to use.</p>

    <p>Another thing that inspired me when creating my website was the games own website for example league of legends has a web page (https://watch.lolesports.com/standings/lcs/lcs_2019_summer/regular_season)
     where they have the standings for the teams  and where they are at on the league so who is in first place and who is in last place and this inspired me to implement it into my own website as some websites such as the Espn one was lacking in giving information on which team is currently winning and losing as it did not have a standings table hence the league of legends web page inspired me to implement that to my website.</p>

<h2>Planning</h2>
<h3>•What type of structure did you choose to implement? 
The type of structure I chose to implement to my website was a hierarchical structure this is because it is easy to navigate and get where you need to get to get the information you are looking for.
•Give (at least) 3 ways in which you have ensured accessibility for your website. If you have used a WCAG tool, or evaluated it manually, give the results of that evaluation.</h3>

    <p>One way in which I ensured accessibility for my website is by implementing @media so the width and size of the text and images change as the web page gets smaller so for example someone on a mobile device would have a smaller web page because their screen is a lot smaller and by doing this they would be able to view the website perfectly fine without and information leaking across the screen allowing them to have accessibility to my website.</p>

    <p>Another way in which I ensured accessibility to my website is by focusing on multiple games to have a web page on which then allows many people to want to use my website for many reasons for example some may want to look at news for a particular game while others may want to look for rumours or league standings and by adding this to my website it allows me to target a variety of people in the market hence allowing accessibility to a variety of different people.</p>

    <p>To my website I have added icons where if you click on them it would refer you to a different website and this can give more accessibility to my website as if someone is reading a news on a particular topic and may want to get into discussions they can click the reddit link and go to a subreddit and find a post where they are able to discuss about that particular topic and give their opinions on that topic which gives accessibility as they are able to go to the right page to be able to talk about that. This gives accessibility as it may cause people to come to my website to be able to find these links to the subreddit or YouTube site to gain more information on particular topics they are interested in.</p>
    
<h3>•Give 3 ways in which you have considered usability on your site.</h3>
    
    <p>One way in which I have considered usability in my website was by implementing the navigation bar and footer this allows usability because if someone wanted to go to a different web page all they would need to do is click on the relevant name on the navigation bar or the footer and they would be able to go to the web page they wanted to be on hence it allows usability as they would not need to constantly type the URL for that specific web page every time they want to change pages.</p>

    <p>Another way in which I have considered usability in my website is by creating an accordion where if someone wants to find out more information about a particular topic all they would need to do is click on the accordion box and the information would drop below it allowing the person to be able to read the information they needed and not be overwhelmed by other information that they did not want to see allowing them to be able to find the information they need easily and not being overwhelmed by other information.</p>

    <p>Lastly another way in which I have considered usability in my website is by keeping a similar format and structure throughout the website so if someone wanted to find out information on a different game than they usually look at it would have the same structure so they would not feel a stranger to it as they are used to the format and structure and as every webpage has a similar structure and format they would easily be able to navigate through it and find what they need to hence allowing my website to have usability.</p>



<h2>Implementation</h2>
<h3>•State 3 things that you had to learn or research when creating the website. How did you find them out? From where? Did you take the examples directly, or did you modify them?</h3>
    <p>One thing I had to research when creating my website was how to use a library and add an accordion I done this by using the jQuery  website (https://jqueryui.com/accordion/) this website showed me how to add the jQuery library to my code and get the accordion function to work I used to code from the website provided and had to change it to be able to style it the way I needed to so I had to adapt the code so it works.</p>

    <p>Another thing I had to research when creating my website was how to add a manual slideshow to my home page I learnt how to do this from the w3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_slideshow.asp) website which had the html, CSS and JS that was needed for it to work and for this I directly took the code and tried to modify it when necessary.</p>

    <p>Lastly I had to research how to add a sidebar with icons which had links to social media websites that moved as you scrolled down or up to my website and I learnt this through the w3schools (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_sticky_social_bar.asp) website I found the code and implemented it into my work the code used a library where you were able to get the icons for social media websites and I had to adapt the CSS of the code a bit so that I could have the icons in front of text and images and I had to change the size of the icons as they were too large for the website.</p>

<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<h3>•What resources does your work use? What libraries, plugins, are included?</h3>
    
    <p>Libraries I used for my website were jQuery this was used for the accordion function I also added icons of social media websites and I were able to get them through Cloudflare. One resource I have used in my website is you can find the page you are looking for directly by writing in the URL so if u wanted to find the CSGO web page you would type http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~oguve001/mywebsite/csgo.html in your search engine or if you wanted the home page you would type http://doc.gold.ac.uk/~oguve001/mywebsite/home.html.</p>
    
<h3>•State 3 things that you think worked particularly well in your work </h3>
    
    <p>Three things that worked particularly well in my website was the accordion function as it works as intended to as it keeps the information in one place and stops the reader being overwhelmed by other information that they may not want to see or need.</p>

    <p>Another thing that worked particularly well in my website was the sticky icons on the side of the screen and the icons would move up and down with the webpage allowing it to create ease for the person using the site as they would not need to scroll all the way to the top of the screen to be able to find the links where they can go into further discussions on the topics they were reading on or find more information on the topics they were reading on.</p>

    <p>Lastly the table I added to my website worked particularly well as it is in the canter of the screen with the correct width where it has the same width as text and images the table works particularly well because it has the necessary information needed which is which team is winning or which team is losing and their points and there is a hover function allowing it to be easier to find the corresponding points/wins/loses to the team names hence allowing it to work particularly well in my website.</p>
    
<h3>•State 3 things that you think might be improved. How would you do them differently another time? How would you fix them given more time now?</h3>
    
    <p>One thing I would improve with my website if I had more time is fix my slideshow function as you need to click on the arrows to have it to show the images and without clicking on the arrows it does not show any images.

    <p>Another thing I would change with my website if I had more time is I would add a live chat function for each web page so the web page you are on you have a live chat for that specific game and are able to choose any username and talk in chat with everyone else that is reading the same article as you and you can get instant feedback on your opinions instead of using the reddit page where feedback on your opinion can take a while to come causing it to be a very long conversation on that topic hence by having a live chat tool it would allow conversations on topics to happen a lot quicker.</p>

    <p>The last thing I would improve about my website if I had more time is my complaints page this is because if you have a problem and write it up and submit it the message goes nowhere so if I had more time I would improve it so that the message goes to an email address so it functions properly and actually work instead of going nowhere.</p>
